The file to modify is auctionInfo.jsx located in src folder.  The html code is to be written in the return section.  Any javascript code in this section such as the variables that have the auction data needs to be within {}.

The filter to limit data to trasnfer to 0xDead has been commented out for now to have some data to look at to format webpage.  It will need uncommented - the correct place to do so is annoted.

The block the data needs to start being collected (ie. first auctino start) needs to be inputted.  It will all be automatic afterwards.  The correct place to do so is annoted.

Dont forget to commit changes after any modification made.



# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
